# Exam Scheduling

In this project, I simulated the creation of a registrar's final exam schedule where no student has two exams at the same time. By using basic graph building and traversal operations and a greedy algorithm to determine an assignment of classes to exam slots, the program can create a schedule such that no student is enrolled in two courses assigned to the same exam slot and any attempt to combine two slots into one would violate the previous stipulation.
